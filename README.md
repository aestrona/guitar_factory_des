Guitar_Factory_DES
==============================

HW3 Discrete event simulation using a guitar factory:


The python code in the 'src/guitar_factory_des/guitar_factory_des.py' attemps to run a simple simulation of a guitar factory(at least a oversimplified version) resources and process times can be change in the in the python code along with the number of simulation and the order size. 

This code can also be run from the command line but the only number of simulation and order size can be adjusted. 

Example running from the command line:
python guitar_factory_des.py --simulations 1000 --guitars 100

an ouput file will also be added to the output folder. It will include the total time in minutes for each simulation.
